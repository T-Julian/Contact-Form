# Contact-Form

This project contains a working HTML contact form using a Bootstrap framework and AJAX with PHP. 

JavaScript magic (jQuery) is used to submit the form via AJAX without reloading the page itself. 

The end result of this project is a working responsive contact form with fields validation and with some basic CSS styling.
